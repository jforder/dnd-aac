    <h2>Emergence of Privacy by Design (PbD)</h2>
    <p><em>Privacy by Design (PbD)</em> is a framework developed by Dr. Ann Cavoukian, 
    Privacy Commissioner of Ontario, Canada, in an effort to shift the conventional 
    method of privacy protection from a reactive regulation and compliance model to a 
    proactive preventative model. <em>PbD</em> originally focused on information technologies, but 
    grew to include organizational practices, and larger information eco-systems. In October 2010, 
    International data protection and privacy commissioners unanimously recognized <em>PbD</em> as an &ldquo;essential 
    component of fundamental privacy protection,&rdquo; and committed to promote <em>Privacy by Design</em> Foundational 
    Principles into their respective regulatory systems, and to encourage the adoption of <em>PbD</em> Principles 
    as part of an organization&lsquo;s default mode of operation. The story of <em>PbD</em> since then is one of rapid 
    adoption around the world. Translated into 25 languages, <em>Privacy by Design</em> is becoming a legal and 
    regulatory requirement in major jurisdictions around the world.</p>
