    <h2><strong>PbD Foundational Principle:</strong> Privacy <strong>Embedded</strong> into Design</h2>
    <p>Privacy is an essential component, and integral to, the design and functionality of IT systems.
Privacy must be embedded into technologies, operations, and information architectures in
a holistic, integrative and creative way. Holistic, because additional, broader contexts must
always be considered. Integrative, because all stakeholders and interests should be consulted.
Creative, because embedding privacy sometimes means re-inventing existing choices because
the alternatives are unacceptable. A systemic, principled approach to embedding privacy
should be adopted &ndash; one that relies upon accepted standards and frameworks, amenable to
external reviews and audits. Wherever possible, detailed privacy impact and risk assessments
should be carried out and published, clearly documenting the privacy risks and all mitigation
measures, including consideration of alternatives and the selection of metrics. The privacy
impacts of the resulting technology, operation or information architecture, and their uses,
should be demonstrably minimized, and not easily degraded through use, misconfiguration or
error.</p>
