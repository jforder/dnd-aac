    <h1>Section 9</h1>
    <h2><strong>PbD Foundational Principle:</strong> Privacy as the <strong>Default Setting</strong></h2>
    <p>We can all be certain of one thing &ndash; the default rules! Privacy by Design seeks maximum
privacy by limiting collection, use and disclosure of data from the start, and protecting residual
data, by default. Where the need or use of personal information is not clear, there shall be
a presumption of privacy and the precautionary principle shall apply: the default settings
shall be the most privacy protective. This could mean foregoing the data, relying on local-side
processing, or dividing the processing into separate parts. The end-result is the same: if an
individual does nothing, their privacy still remains intact. No action is required on the part of
the individual to protect their privacy &ndash; it is built into the system, by default.</p>
