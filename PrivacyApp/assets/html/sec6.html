    <h2>Emergence of Privacy by Design (PbD)</h2>
    <p><em>Privacy by Design (PbD)</em> is a framework developed since the mid-1990s by Ontario&#39;s Information and Privacy Commissioner, Dr. Ann Cavoukian, in an effort to shift the conventional method of privacy protection from a reactive regulation and compliance model to a proactive preventative model. 
      <em>PbD</em> originally focused on information technology, but grew to include organizational practices, and information eco-systems.  
      In October 2010, International Privacy and Data Protection Commissioners unanimously recognized <em>PbD</em> as an &ldquo;essential component of fundamental privacy protection&rdquo; , and committed to promote the incorporation of its <em>Privacy by Design</em> Foundational Principles in privacy policy and legislation in their respective jurisdictions, and to encourage the adoption of <em>PbD</em> principles as part of an organization&#39;s default mode of operation.&rdquo;
       Since then, PbD has figured prominently in regulatory oversight reform proposals in the US and EU. More than a concept, <em>Privacy by Design</em> is becoming a legal and regulatory requirement in major jurisdictions around the world.</p>
