    <h1>Section 8</h1>
    <h2>Beyond FIPPs to Design Thinking</h2>
    <p>The universal principles of the Fair Information Practices (FIPs) are affirmed by those of <em>Privacy
by Design</em>. They go beyond them to seek the highest global standard possible. There is a
growing understanding that innovation, creativity and competitiveness must be approached
from a &ldquo;design-thinking&rdquo; perspective &mdash; namely, a way of viewing the world and overcoming
constraints that is at once holistic, interdisciplinary, integrative, innovative, and inspiring.
Privacy, too, must be approached from the same design-thinking perspective. Privacy must
be incorporated into networked data systems and technologies, by default. Privacy must
become integral to organizational priorities, project objectives, design processes, and planning
operations. Privacy must be embedded into the standards, protocols and processes that touch
our lives. Extending beyond FIPs, <em>PbD</em> represents a significant &ldquo;raising&rdquo; of the bar in the area of
privacy protection.
