    <h1>Section 8</h1>
    <h2><strong>PbD Foundational Principle: Proactive</strong> not Reactive; <strong>Preventative</strong> not Remedial</h2>
<p>The Privacy by Design approach is characterized by proactive rather than reactive measures.
It anticipates and prevents privacy invasive events before they happen. PbD does not wait for
privacy risks to materialize, nor does it offer remedies for resolving privacy infractions once
they have occurred &ndash; it aims to prevent them from occurring. This implies: a clear commitment,
at the highest levels, to set and enforce high standards of privacy &ndash; generally higher than the
standards set out by global laws and regulation; a privacy commitment that is demonstrably
shared throughout by user communities and stakeholders, in a culture of continuous
improvement; and established methods to recognize poor privacy designs, anticipate poor
privacy practices and outcomes, and correct any negative impacts, well before they occur in
proactive, systematic, and innovative ways.
