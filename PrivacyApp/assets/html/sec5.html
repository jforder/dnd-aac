    <h2>Needed: More Robust FIPs</h2>
    <p>Traditional FIPs took a hit after the events of September 11, 2001, when public security
     trumped individual rights. The rise of social, cloud and mobile computing have accelerated
      the creation and sharing of personal information by individuals in the public domain, as
       more and more of this data flows beyond jurisdictional borders. Meanwhile, the growth of
        compliance requirements, such as breach notification, has led to the rapid emergence of
         privacy professionals in the past decade. These professionals are developing privacy best
          practices, standards, and accountability criteria to supplement and deepen FIPs requirements.
           The Information economy requires mature and robust data-handling practices in place to ensure
            confidence and trust among all stakeholders. Global privacy compliance means setting, and adhering
             to, the highest standards.</p>
