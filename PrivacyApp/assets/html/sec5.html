    <h2>Needed: More Robust FIPPs</h2>
    <p>The rise of social, cloud and mobile computing phenomena have challenged traditional FIPPs and the privacy laws based upon them. The rise of user-generated content-creation, publishing and collaborative platforms challenge the &ldquo;private&rdquo; nature of personal data. Globalized data flows and centralized cloud computing services challenge security and accountability requirements. The scale and complexity of modern networked systems and enterprise operations defy understanding and regulation. Mandatory breach notification requirements are exposing poor privacy and security practices, and contributing to the sharp rise in privacy professionals. Legal approaches are evolving, with privacy law updates underway in most major jurisdictions. Global privacy compliance means setting and adhering to the highest standards. International privacy and data protection authorities are coordinating cross-border investigation and enforcement actions.  National and international groups are developing common standards to evaluate privacy maturity, capabilities, claims, risks, and impacts. Many more are offering guidance and best practices. The Information economy requires mature and robust data-handling practices in place to ensure confidence and trust among all stakeholders.</p>
