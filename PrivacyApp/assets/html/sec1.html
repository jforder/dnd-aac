    <h2>Privacy Basics: what is privacy and why does it matter?</h2>
<p>Privacy is synonymous with personal control and freedom of choice. Privacy supports democracy. 
  Throughout history, totalitarian regimes targeted the right to privacy even before they did 
  free speech. Without privacy, individuals are cowed by authority, conform to societal norms, 
  and self-censor dissenting speech &ndash; or even thoughts. Enforceable rules prescribing governance 
  and accountability can curb abuses of personal data collected, used and disclosed by both state 
  and non-state actors. A well-functioning democracy depends on free, empowered private citizens. 
  The Germans understood this, and enshrined the right of &ldquo;informational self-determination&rdquo; into 
  their Constitution, giving citizens strong powers to challenge unjustified invasions of privacy 
  by the public and private organizations.</p>
