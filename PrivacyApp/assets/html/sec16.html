<strong>PbD in Operation</strong></h2>
    <p>Innovative <em>Privacy by Design</em> applications and practices abound. Many use cases are described
and showcased at <a href="http://www.PrivacybyDesign.ca">www.PrivacybyDesign.ca</a>. These include: whole body image security scanners
that detect aviation threats but not the identities of passengers; biometrics systems that
identify only casino patrons who have voluntarily enrolled; interactive digital signage that
targets information and ads based on anonymous viewers&#39; age and gender; privacy-enhanced
road tolling and in-home smart metering and remote-home care applications, and enterprise-
wide information systems that ensure effective oversight and accountability. PbD encourages
the raising of privacy benchmarks, the setting of new privacy practice standards, and open
competition on the basis of strong privacy features.</p>
