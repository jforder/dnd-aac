    <h2>13)<strong>PbD Foundational Principle: Visibility</strong> and <strong>Transparency</strong> &ndash; Keep it <strong>Open</strong></h2>
    <p><em>Privacy by Design</em> seeks to assure all stakeholders that whatever the business practice or
technology involved, it is in fact, operating according to the stated promises and objectives,
subject to independent verification. Its component parts and operations remain visible
and transparent, to both users and providers alike, in order to satisfy customers, business
partners, regulators, and shareholders. Visibility and transparency are essential to establishing
accountability and trust.</p>
