    <p>The objectives of <em>PbD</em> &mdash; ensuring privacy and gaining personal control over one&#39;s information
and, for organizations, gaining a sustainable competitive advantage &mdash; may be accomplished by
applying 7 Foundational Principles:
<ol>
 <li>Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial</li>
 <li>Privacy as the Default Setting</li>
 <li>Privacy Embedded into Design</li>
 <li>Full Functionality &mdash; Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum</li>
 <li>End-to-End Security &mdash; Full Lifecycle Protection</li>
 <li>Visibility and Transparency &mdash; Keep it Open</li>
 <li>Respect for User Privacy &mdash; Keep it User-centric</li>
