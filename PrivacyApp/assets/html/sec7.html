    <h2>7)7 Foundational Principles of Privacy by Design</h2>
    <p>The universal principles of the Fair Information Practices (FIPs) are affirmed 
    and extended by <em>Privacy by Design</em>, which seeks the highest global standard possible. 
    The objectives of PbD &ndash; ensuring privacy and gaining personal control over one&apos;s information 
    and, for organizations, gaining sustainable competitive advantages &ndash; are accomplished by applying 
    the following  Principles:
<br />
&#8226;Proactive not Reactive; Preventative not Remedial<br/>
&#8226;Privacy as the Default Setting<br/>
&#8226;Privacy Embedded into Design<br/>
&#8226;Full Functionality &mdash; Positive-Sum, not Zero-Sum<br/>
&#8226;End-to-End Security &mdash; Full Lifecycle Protection<br/>
&#8226;Visibility and Transparency &mdash; Keep it Open<br/>
&#8226;Respect for User Privacy &mdash; Keep it User-centric<br/>

Extending beyond FIPs, <em>PbD</em> represents a significant &ldquo;raising&rdquo; of the bar in the area of privacy protection.
