    <h2>Fair information Practices Principles (FIPPs)</h2>
    <p>With the shift from industrial manufacturing to knowledge creation and service delivery, the value of data as an asset class has grown dramatically --along with the need to manage it responsibly. Privacy is challenged by rapid innovation, global competition and increasing system complexity. Fortunately, data privacy requirements can be expressed as universal fair information practice principles (FIPPs) that are referenced in privacy protection laws and regulations, policies, codes of practice, and norms. Several sets of FIPPs are in use today; all require organizations to:</p> 
<ol>
<li><strong>Minimize</strong> data everywhere</li> 
<li>Apply strong <strong>safeguards</strong> </li>
<li>Promote <strong>user participation</strong> </li>
<li>Demonstrate <strong>accountability</strong></li>
</ol> 
<p>These universal privacy principles can be applied to technologies, organizational processes, and networked architectures.</p>
