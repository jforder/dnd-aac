    <h2><strong>The Future of Privacy</strong></h2>
    <h3><strong>SmartData</strong></h3>
    <p>
In this age of Big Data feeding the growth of big government and big business, we will need innovative
ways to allow individuals to protect their personal information. We are constantly presented with the
scenario that we have to choose between privacy or public safety; between privacy or better customer
service. This is a false zero-sum paradigm that does not take into account the power of human ingenuity
to create a positive-sum solution that delivers both privacy and public safety; privacy and enhanced
customer service.</p>

<p>
Enter SmartData. SmartData aims to provide this solution by creating Internet-based virtual agents
which will act as an individual's online proxy to securely store their personal information, and disclose
it based upon the context of the data request and instructions authorized by the data subject. In other
words, the individual, via his/her intelligent agent on the Web, would be in complete control of his/
her personal information at all times. No longer could organizations use personal data in ways that
contradicted an individual&#39;s choices (unless authorized by a judicial warrant).
</p>

<p>
The bottom line is that a future without privacy would be a future without freedom. That is simply an
unacceptable prospect. SmartData&#39;s goal is to ensure the future of privacy, which in turn, is crucial
to advancing freedom, liberty and prosperity. We hope you will take part in building this vital pillar
supporting our freedoms as a society. It will be important in protecting the right to privacy, not only in
our physical homes, but in our &ldquo;cyber-homes&rdquo;.</p>
