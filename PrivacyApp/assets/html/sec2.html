    <h2>2)How is information privacy expressed?</h2>
    <p>Privacy is not an absolute right or value. It varies according to socio-cultural-technological factors. 
    For most of history, privacy was guaranteed by obscurity: little was recorded, or else it was buried away. 
    Industrial-era information and communications technologies and the rise of mass media shaped western privacy concepts, 
    as did the abuses of secret dossiers by consumer rating agencies and by totalitarian state actors. The plague of data 
    breaches and twin scourges of identity fraud and theft are testament to the ease of obtaining personal information and 
    misusing it to the detriment of others, not to mention the gross mishandling of data by government, financial, retail, 
    health , and academic enterprises.  The European approach to privacy is human rights-based, broad in scope, and guaranteed 
    by the state. The U.S. approach is harms-based, sectoral in scope, and more litigious in nature. </p>
