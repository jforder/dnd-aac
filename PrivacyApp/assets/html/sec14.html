    <h2>14)<strong>PbD Foundational Principle: Respect</strong> for User Privacy &ndash; Keep it <strong>User-Centric</strong></h2>
    <p>Above all, <em>Privacy by Design</em> requires architects and operators to keep the interests of the
individual uppermost by offering such measures as strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice
and user-interface / experience designs, and empowering user-friendly options. The best
<em>Privacy by Design</em> results are usually those that are consciously designed around the interests,
expectations, needs and rights of individual users, who have the greatest vested interest in
the management of their personal data. Empowering data subjects to play an active role in
the management of their own data may be the single most effective check against abuses and
misuses of privacy and personal data. Individual consent must be lawful, informed and freely
given, may come with conditions attached, and be changed or revoked. Rights of user access,
correction and redress have enormous potential to hold firms accountable for their privacy
policies and procedures,</p>
