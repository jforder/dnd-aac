    <h2><strong>PbD Foundational Principle:</strong> End-to-End Security <strong>&ndash; Full Lifecycle Protection</strong></h2>
    <p>Privacy by Design, having been embedded into the system prior to the first element of
information being collected, should extend securely throughout the entire lifecycle of the data
involved &ndash; strong security measures are essential to privacy, from start to finish. This ensures
that all data are securely retained, and then securely destroyed at the end of the process, in a
timely fashion. Thus, <em>Privacy by Design</em> ensures cradle to grave, secure lifecycle management of
information, end-to-end. Privacy must be continuously protected across the entire domain and
throughout the life-cycle of the data in question. There should be no gaps in either protection
or accountability. The &ldquo;Security&rdquo; principle has special relevance here because, at its essence,
without strong security, there can be no privacy.</p>
