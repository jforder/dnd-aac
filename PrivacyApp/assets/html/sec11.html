    <h2>11)<strong>PbD Foundational Principle:</strong> Full Functionality <strong>&ndash; Positive-Sum</strong>, not Zero-Sum</h2>
    <p>Privacy by Design seeks to accommodate all legitimate interests and objectives in a positive-
sum &ldquo;win-win&rdquo; manner, avoiding false dichotomies, such as privacy vs. security, and
demonstrating real, practical results. When embedding privacy into a given technology,
process, or system, it should be done in such a way that full functionality is not impaired, and
all requirements are optimized. Privacy is often positioned in a zero-sum manner as having to
compete with other legitimate interests, design objectives, and technical capabilities, in a given
domain. <em>Privacy by Design</em> embraces legitimate non-privacy objectives and accommodates
them in an innovative, positive-sum manner. All interests and objectives must be clearly
documented, desired functions articulated, metrics agreed upon and applied, and unnecessary
trade-offs rejected, in favour of finding a solution that enables multi-functionality.</p>
