    <h2>4)Privacy Under Attack</h2>
    <p>In the past, we enjoyed privacy by obscurity: little was recorded, papers gathered dust, 
    and we paid in cash. Today, thanks to astonishing advances in sensors, bandwidth, storage and 
    computing power, we are generating personal data everywhere we go. These data trails are being 
    aggregated, sorted, data-mined and sold for their insights and predictive powers. Big Data is 
    Big Business. With so much personal data, it&lsquo;s inevitable that some it &ndash;a lot, really &ndash; goes astray. 
    Data breaches are just the tip of the iceberg. 85% of personal data collected is managed by third parties, 
    perhaps based in foreign jurisdictions where privacy laws are weaker. Large-scale data breaches are occurring 
    with depressing frequency, triggering notifications and undermining trust. The loss of practical obscurity has 
    been matched by growing obscurity of oversight and accountability for personal data, and an erosion of individual 
    control and freedoms.</p>
