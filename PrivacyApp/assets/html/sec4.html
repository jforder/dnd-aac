    <h2>Privacy Under Attack</h2>
    <p>In the past, we enjoyed privacy by obscurity: little was recorded, papers gathered dust in filing cabinets, and we paid in cash. Today, our behaviors are monitored continuously, online and off, creating digital trails, profiled for sorting and discrimination, data mined for insights and prediction, and sold as a commodity. We generate more personal data in a day than our grandparents did in a year, thanks to astonishing advances in sensors, bandwidth, storage and computing power. 85% of data collected about us is managed or hosted by third parties, often based in foreign jurisdictions where privacy laws are weaker. Large-scale data breaches are occurring with depressing frequency, triggering notifications and undermining trust. The loss of practical obscurity has been accompanied by diminished oversight and accountability for our personal data, and a loss of individual control and freedom</p>
